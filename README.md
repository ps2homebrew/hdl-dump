## Intro

The latest version, as well as documentation can be found on the new official repository, <https://github.com/ps2homebrew/hdl-dump/>

Me reads <w1zard0f07@yahoo.com> and psx-scene forums every now and then.

Easy guide for installing games can be found here <http://web.archive.org/web/20120720230755/http://openps2loader.info/hdldump/howto.html>


## Networking server

A UDP-based network server is available, based on the SMAP driver recently released on psx-scene forums <http://ichiba.geocities.jp/ysai187/PS2/smap.htm>. It is called `hdl_svr_093.elf` and is now part of the `hdl_dump` sources.

_**Note**: You might need to punch a hole in your firewall for incoming UDP from port 12345._


## Compilation

First of all you have to update your PS2SDK.

Next: you have to run `diskload.sh` to get the latest version of MiniOPL.

Finally: You just can run shell script in the project folder: `mkrel.sh`. It will compile both gui and normal version for Windows.

* **Linux**: Build and copy executable into a directory of your choice.  
	`make RELEASE=yes`  
  Advanced Linux build commands:  
	`make XC=win          # for Windows cross-compilation using mingw32`  
	`make -C gui          # for WineLib compilation (for now doesn't work)`  
	`make -C gui XC=win   # for GUI cross-compilation using mingw32`

* **Mac OS X** or **FreeBSD**: You'll need to have GNU make installed, then  
	`gmake RELEASE=yes IIN_OPTICAL_MMAP=no`  
  or  
	`make RELEASE=yes IIN_OPTICAL_MMAP=no`

* **Windows**: You need to have [CYGWIN](http://www.cygwin.com/) installed;  
  then use  
	`make RELEASE=yes`  
	`make -C gui RELEASE=yes`  
  to compile command-line or GUI version.  
  You can use [this guide](http://psx-scene.com/forums/f150/compiling-windows-118947/#post1124987) for preparing sdk for Windows.

## Configuration and list file location

You can place this files in folder where is installed hdl_dump for making it portable.

* **Windows**: (cited names are for English version of Windows)  
  `C:\Documents and Settings\<login name>\Application Data\hdl_dump.conf`  
  `C:\Documents and Settings\<login name>\Application Data\hdl_dump.list`

* **Linux**, **Mac OS X** and **FreeBSD**: (`~` is your home dir)  
  `~/.hdl_dump.conf`  
  `~/.hdl_dump.list`


## Configuration

* `disc_database_file` -- full path to your disc compatibility database file;


## New features

All new stuff can be used from HDDOSD or BB Navigator or XMB from PSX DVR.


### `inject_dvd`, `inject_cd`, `install` or `copy_hdd`.

This command will install games onto the hard disk.

_**Warning**: You need to specify a DMA mode (like `*u4`, `*m2`) or `hdl_dump` crashes._

_**Warning**: Be careful with `copy_hdd` - every HDLoader game will be given the same icon._

Optionally, you can place `boot.elf` (which is actually `miniopl.elf`) in the folder where `hdl_dump` is launched from.
You can also optionally include `list.ico` (`*.ico` from memory card) and `icon.sys` (`*.sys` from memory card), or you can write your own `icon.sys` file.

If you don't include an `*.ico`, the HDLoader logo is used. If you don't include `*.sys`, the default HDLoader icon settings are used..

`boot.elf` - you can use everything but I prefer miniopl. Miniopl allows you to launch titles from HDD OSD or BB NAV by pressing on title.

`boot.elf` injection address - `0x111000`

`boot.elf` size limit - 2,026,464 bytes (thanks to kHn)


### `initialize`

When you use this command and place the hard drive into your PlayStation 2 phat, it will launch the injected `MBR.KELF`. So it can be used as Free MCBoot replacement (no need for memory card or modchip for lauching homebrews).

All you need to do is place `MBR.KELF` in the corresponding folder. All HDD data will remain intact.

`MBR.KELF` injection address - `0x404000` (for compatibility with PlayStation BB Navigator)

`MBR.KELF` doesn't have any restrictions by itself.

There is no easy way to make `MBR.KELF`s from a common elf.

_**Note**: In a previous version this command tried to install one `__mbr` partition, but this command didn't work correctly and was replaced with MBR injection._


### `modify_header`

This command injects header attributes into an existing partition.

```
hdl_dump.exe modify_header 192.168.0.10 PP.TEST
```

It can inject these files:

* `system.cnf`
* `icon.sys`
* `list.ico`
* `del.ico`
* `boot.kelf`
* `boot.elf`
* `boot.kirx`

Any one can be skipped. It first tries to inject `boot.kelf`, then if not found it will try to inject `boot.elf`.

Now `icon.sys` can be in any of 2 formats: Memory Card format or HDD format.

`del.ico` injection address: `0x041000` (If `del.ico` is used `list.ico` maximum size 260,096 bytes)

`boot.elf` (or `boot.kelf`) injection address - `0x111000`

`boot.elf` size limit - 2,026,464 bytes (thanks to kHn)

`boot.kelf` size limit - 3,076,096 bytes (if `boot.kirx` not used)

`boot.kelf` size limit - 2,031,616 bytes (if `boot.kirx` is used)

`boot.kirx` injection address - `0x301000`

`boot.kirx` size limit - 1,044,480 bytes


### Others

If you want to know more about these files (and their restrictions) you have to study official ps2sdk document called `hdd_rule_3.0.2.pdf`

There are also some undocumented features like this:

* If you want to inject `boot.kelf` (or `boot.elf`) you have to change `BOOT2` in `system.cnf`

  ```
  BOOT2 = PATINFO
  ```

  This is used for HDL games for example.
  If you need to erase `boot.elf` from PATINFO you have to place zero-sized `boot.kelf` or elf in program folder.

* If you want to launch KELF from PFS partition you have to change `BOOT2` in `system.cnf` 

  ```
  BOOT2 = pfs:/EXECUTE.KELF
  ```

  where `EXECUTE.KELF` - is path to KELF which is placed into partition. Can be changed.

* If you want to inject kirx into partition you have to add a line into `system.cnf` 

  ```
  IOPRP = PATINFO
  ```

  Don't ask me about kirx - I don't know where it can be used.

* If you don't want to boot from HDD OSD you have to add such a line into system.cnf 

  ```
  BOOT2 = NOBOOT
  ```

Happy gaming.

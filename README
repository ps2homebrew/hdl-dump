Intro
-----

Latest version, as well as some? documentation (ha-ha-ha) could be
found on the official site -- http://hdldump.ps2-scene.org/.
Me reads w1zard0f07@yahoo.com and ps2-scene forums now and then.


General
-------

It is advised (but not strictly necessary) to remove your old
configuration file before using the new version. Client 0.8.4 must be
compatible with server version 0.8.3a, too. Server version 0.8.3
should NOT be used as it is buggy and almost certainly will corrupt
data during installation.


Compilation
-----------

* Windows: You need to have CYGWIN (http://www.cygwin.com/) installed;
then use
	make RELEASE=yes
	make -c gui RELEASE=yes
to compile command-line or GUI version.

NOTICE: with current compilation flags hdl_dump would not handle
correctly Ctrl+C if ran from-within a CYGWIN shell. AFAIR, removing
"-mno-cygwin" might correct this behaviour, but will break Ctrl+C
handling when ran from a Command Prompt.

* Linux: Build and copy executable into a directory of your choice.
	make RELEASE=yes
Advanced Linux build commands:
	make XC=win          # for Windows cross-compilation using mingw32
	make -c gui          # for WineLib compilation
	make -c gui XC=win   # for GUI cross-compilation using mingw32

* FreeBSD and MacOS X: You'll need to have GNU make installed, then
	gmake RELEASE=yes IIN_OPTICAL_MMAP=no
or
	make RELEASE=yes IIN_OPTICAL_MMAP=no


Configuration and list file location
------------------------------------

* Windows: (cited names are for English version of Windows)
C:\Documents and Settings\<login name>\Application Data\hdl_dump.conf
C:\Documents and Settings\<login name>\Application Data\hdl_dump.list

* Linux, FreeBSD and MacOS X: (~ is your home dir)
~/.hdl_dump.conf
~/.hdl_dump.list


Configuration
-------------

* disc_database_file -- full path to your disc compatibility database
file;

* limit_to_28bit -- whether to "imagine" that HDD is not bigger than
128GB; necessary if you use ToxicOS with APA-EXT partitioning;

* partition_naming -- put signature (toxicos) or game label (standard)
to partition name;

* target_kbps -- target speed to follow when installing games via
networking; look below.


Network speed notes
-------------------

Networking server is able to accept a limited number of bytes per
second. Any extra bytes send would probably be missed -- "dropped on
the floor" -- as UDP is unreliable protocol. For not to corrupt data
the client will ask the server if it got all the data send and will
retransmit some or all of the missed bytes if necessary. Hence if the
client sends data too quickly it will need to make a retry and there
will be a waste of time. However, if it sends the data too slowly
there will be a waste of bandwidth.

"target_kbps" controls the number of kbytes client will send each
second. The "maximum" practical speed depends on many factors, like OS
and maybe kernel compilation flags -- mostly timer granularity -- as
client uses sleep and benefits greatly from high-resolution timers.
"2350" is a good default value, which gives about 2,1MB/sec. "2500"
works great on my Linux box, making 2,25MB/sec, but performs badly on
a Windows machine decreasing speed below 1,6MB/sec.

Run a few tries and pick a number for yourself.



Happy gaming.

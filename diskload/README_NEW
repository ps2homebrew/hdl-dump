This source is a EXTREMELY "trimmed down" version of Open PS2 Loader (OpenUsbLd) 
which contains only the emulator core and support for SONY DEV9 based harddrives.

It uses argv[] as parameter for information on which partition it's expected to boot.

This software is meant to be embeded on a KELF file and then installed on a 
HDL format (0x1337 partition type) partition, making it bootable through 
the PlayStation 2 HDD OSD.
